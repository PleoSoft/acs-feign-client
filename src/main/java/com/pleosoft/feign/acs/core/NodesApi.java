	/**
	 * Create a node
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * **Note:** this endpoint is available in Alfresco 5.2 and newer versions.
	 * Create a node and add it as a primary child of node **nodeId**. This
	 * endpoint supports both JSON and multipart/form-data (file upload).
	 * **Using multipart/form-data** Use the **filedata** field to represent the
	 * content to upload, for example, the following curl command will create a
	 * node with the contents of test.txt in the test user's home folder.
	 * ```curl -utest:test -X POST
	 * host:port/alfresco/api/-default-/public/alfresco/versions/1/nodes/-my-/children
	 * -F filedata=@test.txt``` You can use the **name** field to give an
	 * alternative name for the new file. You can use the **nodeType** field to
	 * create a specific type. The default is cm:content. You can use the
	 * **renditions** field to create renditions (e.g. doclib) asynchronously
	 * upon upload. Also, as requesting rendition is a background process, any
	 * rendition failure (e.g. No transformer is currently available) will not
	 * fail the whole upload and has the potential to silently fail. Use
	 * **overwrite** to overwrite an existing file, matched by name. If the file
	 * is versionable, the existing content is replaced. When you overwrite
	 * existing content, you can set the **majorVersion** boolean field to
	 * **true** to indicate a major version should be created. The default for
	 * **majorVersion** is **false**. Setting **majorVersion** enables
	 * versioning of the node, if it is not already versioned. When you
	 * overwrite existing content, you can use the **comment** field to add a
	 * version comment that appears in the version history. This also enables
	 * versioning of this node, if it is not already versioned. You can set the
	 * **autoRename** boolean field to automatically resolve name clashes. If
	 * there is a name clash, then the API method tries to create a unique name
	 * using an integer suffix. You can use the **relativePath** field to
	 * specify the folder structure to create relative to the node **nodeId**.
	 * Folders in the **relativePath** that do not exist are created before the
	 * node is created. Any other field provided will be treated as a property
	 * to set on the newly created node. **Note:** setting properties of type
	 * d:content and d:category are not supported. **Using JSON** You must
	 * specify at least a **name** and **nodeType**. For example, to create a
	 * folder: ```JSON { \"name\":\"My Folder\", \"nodeType\":\"cm:folder\" }
	 * ``` You can create an empty file like this: ```JSON { \"name\":\"My text
	 * file.txt\", \"nodeType\":\"cm:content\" } ``` You can update binary
	 * content using the ```PUT /nodes/{nodeId}``` API method. You can create a
	 * folder, or other node, inside a folder hierarchy: ```JSON { \"name\":\"My
	 * Special Folder\", \"nodeType\":\"cm:folder\", \"relativePath\":\"X/Y/Z\"
	 * } ``` The **relativePath** specifies the folder structure to create
	 * relative to the node **nodeId**. Folders in the **relativePath** that do
	 * not exist are created before the node is created. You can set properties
	 * when you create a new node: ```JSON { \"name\":\"My Other Folder\",
	 * \"nodeType\":\"cm:folder\", \"properties\": { \"cm:title\":\"Folder
	 * title\", \"cm:description\":\"This is an important folder\" } } ``` Any
	 * missing aspects are applied automatically. For example, **cm:titled** in
	 * the JSON shown above. You can set aspects explicitly, if needed, using an
	 * **aspectNames** field. **Note:** setting properties of type d:content and
	 * d:category are not supported. Typically, for files and folders, the
	 * primary children are created within the parent folder using the default
	 * \"cm:contains\" assocType. If the content model allows then it is also
	 * possible to create primary children with a different assoc type. For
	 * example: ```JSON { \"name\":\"My Node\",
	 * \"nodeType\":\"my:specialNodeType\", \"association\": {
	 * \"assocType\":\"my:specialAssocType\" } } ``` Additional associations can
	 * be added after creating a node. You can also add associations at the time
	 * the node is created. This is required, for example, if the content model
	 * specifies that a node has mandatory associations to one or more existing
	 * nodes. You can optionally specify an array of **secondaryChildren** to
	 * create one or more secondary child associations, such that the newly
	 * created node acts as a parent node. You can optionally specify an array
	 * of **targets** to create one or more peer associations such that the
	 * newly created node acts as a source node. For example, to associate one
	 * or more secondary children at time of creation: ```JSON { \"name\":\"My
	 * Folder\", \"nodeType\":\"cm:folder\", \"secondaryChildren\": [
	 * {\"childId\":\"abcde-01234-...\",
	 * \"assocType\":\"my:specialChildAssocType\"} ] } ``` For example, to
	 * associate one or more targets at time of creation: ```JSON {
	 * \"name\":\"My Folder\", \"nodeType\":\"cm:folder\", \"targets\": [
	 * {\"targetId\":\"abcde-01234-...\",
	 * \"assocType\":\"my:specialPeerAssocType\"} ] } ``` **Note:** You can
	 * create more than one child by specifying a list of nodes in the JSON
	 * body. For example, the following JSON body creates two folders inside the
	 * specified **nodeId**, if the **nodeId** identifies a folder: ```JSON [ {
	 * \"name\":\"My Folder 1\", \"nodeType\":\"cm:folder\" }, { \"name\":\"My
	 * Folder 2\", \"nodeType\":\"cm:folder\" } ] ``` If you specify a list as
	 * input, then a paginated list rather than an entry is returned in the
	 * response body. For example: ```JSON { \"list\": { \"pagination\": {
	 * \"count\": 2, \"hasMoreItems\": false, \"totalItems\": 2, \"skipCount\":
	 * 0, \"maxItems\": 100 }, \"entries\": [ { \"entry\": { ... } }, {

	/**
	 * Lock a node
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * **Note:** this endpoint is available in Alfresco 5.2 and newer versions.
	 * Places a lock on node **nodeId**. **Note:** you can only lock files. More
	 * specifically, a node can only be locked if it is of type `cm:content` or
	 * a subtype of `cm:content`. The lock is owned by the current user, and
	 * prevents other users or processes from making updates to the node until
	 * the lock is released. If the **timeToExpire** is not set or is zero, then
	 * the lock never expires. Otherwise, the **timeToExpire** is the number of
	 * seconds before the lock expires. When a lock expires, the lock is
	 * released. If the node is already locked, and the user is the lock owner,
	 * then the lock is renewed with the new **timeToExpire**. By default, a
	 * lock is applied that allows the owner to update or delete the node. You
	 * can use **type** to change the lock type to one of the following: *
	 * **ALLOW_OWNER_CHANGES** (default) changes to the node can be made only by
	 * the lock owner. This enum is the same value as the deprecated WRITE_LOCK
	 * described in `org.alfresco.service.cmr.lock.LockType` in the Alfresco
	 * Public Java API. This is the default value. * **FULL** no changes by any
	 * user are allowed. This enum is the same value as the deprecated
	 * READ_ONLY_LOCK described in `org.alfresco.service.cmr.lock.LockType` in
	 * the Alfresco Public Java API. By default, a lock is persisted in the
	 * database. You can create a volatile in-memory lock by setting the
	 * **lifetime** property to EPHEMERAL. You might choose use EPHEMERAL locks,
	 * for example, if you are taking frequent short-term locks that you don't
	 * need to be kept over a restart of the repository. In this case you don't
	 * need the overhead of writing the locks to the database. If a lock on the
	 * node cannot be taken, then an error is returned.
